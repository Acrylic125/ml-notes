    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is when the data used to learn is 'labelled' with a corresponding output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression\n",
    "Regression problems are based off of continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "- Weight\n",
    "- Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "Classification problems are based off of discrete data, data that is of some number of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- Yes/No\n",
    "- Type of fruit\n",
    "- Animal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is when the data used to learn is not labelled with a corresponding output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "Clustering is when the data is grouped into clusters based on some similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- Grouping people into groups based on their interests.\n",
    "- Grouping websites into groups based on their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a way to produce a result based on a reward system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "- A robot that learns to navigate a maze based on the reward of getting to the end of the maze.\n",
    "- A computer that learns to play a game based on the reward of winning the game.\n"
